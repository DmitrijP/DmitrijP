# Hi there, I’m Dmitrij Patuk  

Hi, I’m **Dmitrij Patuk**, a software engineer and educator from Mannheim, Germany.  
I train **Azubis (apprentices)** at work, create programming tutorials on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DmitrijPatuk), and share projects here on GitHub that reflect both my teaching and personal learning journey.

## About Me  

I am a passionate software engineer and educator based in Mannheim, Germany.  

**Educator & Mentor**  
At work, I train and mentor Azubis (apprentices), helping them develop strong practical skills and a solid understanding of modern software engineering principles. I enjoy guiding others, breaking down complex concepts, and making them approachable in real-world projects.  

**Content Creator**  
I also run a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DmitrijPatuk), where I create tutorials about programming concepts, frameworks, and software development projects. Many of the repositories here on GitHub complement my videos and provide learners with code they can study and experiment with.  

**Developer & Explorer**  
Beyond teaching, I enjoy experimenting with different programming languages such as Java, Go, Python, and C#. My projects range from small tools to interpreters and lightweight frameworks — often with a focus on understanding the fundamentals of software systems.
